#### Feature List

- Can utilize [https://letsencrypt.org/](https://letsencrypt.org/){:target="_blank"} or other ACME compliant Certificate Authority for issuing certificates
- Leverages and extends [https://certbot.eff.org/](https://certbot.eff.org/){:target="_blank"} for managing (create/renew) certificates
- Should only be executed on Openshift Container Platform
- Creates an OpenShift CronJob which will run on a regular schedule for renewing TLS certificates
- If a cert is created/renewed, patch the new certificate to the managed OpenShift routes

#### Self-hosted
