#### Manage your access to our hosted APIs using the API Services Portal

<p class="mb-3">The API Services Portal is a self-serve tool for providing teams access (via client credentials) to the following hosted API's:</p>

- <a href="/common-service-showcase/services/ches.html">Common Hosted Email Service</a>
- <a href="/common-service-showcase/services/cdogs.html">Common Document Generation Service</a>

#### How To Use the API Services Portal

###### Step 1 Find the API
Go to the <a href="https://api.gov.bc.ca/devportal/api-directory" target="_blank">the API Services Portal</a> and find the API in the Directory.

###### Step 2 Request Access to API
Submit the â€œRequest Access" form for your application. You will get an email (typically within an hour or so) once your Request is completed.

###### Step 3 Save your Client Credentials
Once approved, your credentials will become active and you will have the API Access. Make sure you save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** securely. If you lose your Client Secret you will have to generate a new one.

###### Step 4 Test with your data and get familiar with API usage (Optional)
See the service page for the API Specifications as well as a Postman Collection.<br />
